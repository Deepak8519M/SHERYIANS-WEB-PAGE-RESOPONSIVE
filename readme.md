✨ _This project is part of my ongoing web development journey to sharpen skills in HTML, CSS, and responsive design._

This project is a **practice copy version** of a section from the [Sheryians Coding School](https://sheryians.com) website.  
⚠️ **Note:** This is **not the original website**, but rather a **self-built clone attempt** to learn and explore advanced CSS concepts like `background-clip`, `filter: blur()`, `::before` pseudo-elements, and responsive font sizing with `vw` units.
